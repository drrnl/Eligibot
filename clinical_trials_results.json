SCED are experimental designs aiming at testing the effect of an intervention using a small number of patients using repeated measurements, sequential and randomized introduction of an intervention and method-specific data analysis, including visual analysis and specific statistics.\n\nDuring baseline, patients will have a rehabilitation program in day hospital (4 days per week) with physiotherapy and physical activity and if necessary occupational and speech therapy. Isokinetic strength training will be added to this conventionnal rehabilitation program and will begin after 3, 4 or 5 weeks of baseline according to randomization\n\n12 patients will be included in this study (6 patients in subacute stage and 6 in chronic stage )."

We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease, with a clinically relevant context of use.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood-brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features."

                    "briefSummary": "Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are clusters of abnormal blood vessels in the brain and spine. CCMs can bleed and cause strokes, seizures, and headaches. CCMs are often caused by an inherited gene mutation (alteration) in one of three CCM genes (CCM1, CCM2, or CCM3). There is a wide range of disease severity even among family members with this disease, though the natural history has not been clearly described for this particular population.\n\nThis study will continue to enroll and follow participants with familial CCM to identify factors that influence CCM disease severity and progression, focusing on barriers to clinical trial preparedness. Our long-term goal is to identify measurable outcomes and robust biomarkers that will help select high-risk patients and help monitor drug response in future clinical trials.\n\nThe specific goals of this study are to:\n\n* Identify factors that influence lesion progression to symptomatic hemorrhage and other outcomes, including quality of life;\n* Investigate the role of the gut microbiome and lesion burden in CCM disease, and\n* Identify blood biomarkers predictive of CCM disease severity and progression for clinical trials.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This study is one of three projects participating in the Brain Vascular Malformation Consortium (BVMC) funded by the Office of Rare Diseases Research, which is part of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).\n\nThe CCM project is a cross-sectional and longitudinal study of familial CCM patients. The study is currently in the third 5-year cycle. During the first 5 year cycle (BVMC1), the CCM project was focused on recruiting CCM1 cases with the common Hispanic mutation (CHM). In the second 5-year cycle (BVMC2), we expanded recruitment to include not only CCM1-CHM cases, but also other CCM familial patients and mutation carriers. In the third 5-year cycle (BVMC3), we will continue to recruit familial CCM cases and expand to additional recruitment sites.\n\nWe collect clinical, genetic, imaging, treatment, and outcome data in participants, and follow enrolled participants over time to understand the natural history of this disease.\n\nFor new study participants, you will be asked to:\n\n* Give permission for study staff to access your medical records to collect clinical information and to obtain copies of MRI scans and reports.\n* Fill out a questionnaire about your quality of life, family history, and medical/surgical history.\n* Give a blood and/or saliva sample, and stool sample.\n* Give permission to store and use your CCM resected tissue for research (if undergoing surgery).\n* Participate in annual follow-ups to update medical, surgical, and neurological information.\n\nEligible cases include those with a known genetic mutation in one of the three CCM genes or those that meet 2 of 3 following clinical criteria:\n\n1. Clinical diagnosis of CCM,\n2. Multi-focal lesions on MRI, and/or\n3. Family history of CCMs.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients who cannot or are unwilling to sign informed consent and for whom no appropriate surrogate is available.\n2. Prisoners and homeless individuals because of the inability to contact the subject and collect follow-up data using standard procedures."

                    "briefSummary": "Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM)-related epilepsy (CRE) impairs the quality of life in patients with CCM. Patients could not always achieve seizure freedom after surgical resection of the lesion, suggesting an inadequate treatment and evaluation of the epileptogenic zone or network. Iron deposition in cerebral cavernous malformations has been postulated to play an important role in triggering CRE. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), as an optimal in vivo imaging technique to quantify iron deposition, is employed to analyze the iron quantity in CCM patients with epilepsy and further combined with brain structural and connectome analysis, to describe the difference between CCMs with and without epilepsy. In vivo biomarkers predicting CRE risk in CCM natural history and CRE control outcome after CCM surgical resection will be further identified to improve management strategy.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The CRESS study is a prospective observational study of imaging biomarker for cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) related epilepsy (CRE) risk in natural history or after surgical resection. This project, funded by the National Nature Science Foundation of China, will be performed in two sites: Bejing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University and Peking University International Hospital, which cover the south and north part of Beijing. Bejing Tiantan Hospital is also the China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases and the largest neurological center with high volume of patients all over the nation.\n\nStudy overview: Each participants will be followed for 5 year since enrollment. Epilepsy will be tracked with serial video EEG recordings and clinical investigations performed annually. Besides medical history of the patients, data from seizure diary and MR imaging studies (including quantitative susceptibility mapping, diffusion tensor imaging and three dimension-T1 weighted imaging), will be collected. Blood samples and tissue samples of surgical resected lesion for biomarkers studies will also be collected in all participants of the project. The data obtained in participants of CCM with or without epilepsy will be compared.\n\nSample size: Investigators plan to enroll 200 CCM patients in 24 months and follow up for 5 years. Based upon the preliminary results and extensive literature review, investigators predict that about 50% of participants will undergo surgical treatment, while 25% of participants remain suffering from seizure after treatment.\n\nStudy endpoints: The primary clinical endpoint of this study is a collection of a set of clinical, molecular, and MRI data in all participants."

The study focuses on individuals who have been diagnosed with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs).\n\nMain Questions to Answer:\n\nHow can AI-based radiomics features predict the risk of complications (such as bleeding or epilepsy) in individuals with CCMs? What are the most reliable imaging and clinical markers for assessing the prognosis of CCMs? Participants will be required to undergo regular medical imaging to gather traditional and radiomics imaging features.\n\nParticipants will provide clinical data, including past medical history and results of any laboratory tests.\n\nParticipants will be part of a three-year follow-up observation to monitor the progression or stability of CCMs.\n\nContribution of biological samples for advanced testing might also be requested.\n\nThis study aims to create an AI-based decision-making tool that will guide clinicians in the management of CCM, with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes through personalized medical approaches."

                    "briefSummary": "In 2019, approximately 2.4 billion people worldwide required rehabilitation for various health pathologies, a 63% increase since 1990. It has been suggested that current rehabilitation frameworks (inpatient, outpatient, and community-based) are insufficient to meet local population needs due to issues like long waiting times, lack of facilities, prioritization, funding, and accessibility.Patients with lower limb weaknesses, resulting from various conditions (for example stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury and others) require long-term management and motivation for engagement, which are crucial for functional outcomes. This highlights the need for sustainable gait and balance rehabilitation.\n\nNew technologies like exoskeletons have shown promising results in short-term inpatient programs, improving gait, balance, and quality of life, however, long-term follow-up data are still needed.\n\nThe present clinical investigation is a national, prospective, open-label interventional trial, proposing a 12-month outpatient rehabilitation program with the Atalante X exoskeleton to treat lower limb weakness and/or impairments in 100 participants. The rehabilitation program consists of at least one exoskeleton rehabilitation session per week. At the end of the first-year experimental phase, participants can continue for an additional year in the voluntary phase. The program aims to explore the potential long-term effects of supervised robotic rehabilitation on motor, cognitive, bowel, bladder functions, quality of life, and well-being. Assessments are conducted at baseline, after 4 and 12 months of exoskeleton rehabilitation, and at 16 and 24 months for participants in the voluntary phase."

The resulting deficits are numerous and lead in particular to an alteration in the quality of walking and autonomy. Numerous rehabilitation techniques have been described. In practice, correction instructions are often given by the therapist while the motor activity is being performed. Walking is a complex activity, as is the processing of dual-task information in elderly stroke patients. It therefore appears interesting to separate the time of motor realization and that of correction instructions. Investigators therefore propose firstly to film the patient during the performance of a walking activity and then, secondly, to analyse the video with the patient, which thus represents a source of delayed feedback. The main objective of the study is to observe the effects of this practice on walking speed. Investigators are comparing two groups of patients: the control group receiving conventional rehabilitation and the experimental group receiving conventional rehabilitation plus sessions with the video tool. They expect to observe a greater improvement in walking speed in the experimental group."

                    "briefSummary": "This study is a necessary and important step in the development of a new therapy for upper limb functional recovery in patients with severe motor impairment. It is the first clinical trial of non-invasive brain stimulation (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or rTMS) delivered to excite the undamaged hemisphere (specifically the contralesional higher motor cortices or cHMC) in stroke. Therefore, this study will determine whether the positive results obtained in our short-term pilot study can be made to last longer and produce functional benefits in severe patients with the application of brain stimulation in combination with long-term rehabilitation therapy. Rehabilitation therapy administered is called contralaterally controlled functional electrical stimulation (CCFES). Determining whether combining rTMS facilitating the cHMC with CCFES produces synergistic gains in functional abilities in severe patients is necessary for acceptance by the clinical community and to move this technology toward commercialization and widespread dissemination. The proposed study will determine whether the combination of rTMS facilitating the cHMC with CCFES produces greater improvements in upper extremity function in severe participants who are \u22656 months from stroke onset than the combination of rTMS facilitating the damaged hemisphere (specifically the ipsilesional primary motor cortex, iM1) and CCFES or the combination of sham rTMS and CCFES. The secondary purposes are to define which patients benefit most from the treatments, which may inform future device and treatment development and clinical translation, and to explore what distinct effects the three treatments have on the brain. To accomplish these purposes, we are conducting a clinical trial that enrolls severe stroke patients.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Overall Study Design Summary: We propose a 5-yr RCT in which 72 stroke patients who are \\>6 months post-stroke are randomized to 12 wks of one of 3 treatments: (1) CCFES + cHMC facilitation, (2) CCFES + iM1 facilitation, (3) CCFES + Sham rTMS. The treatment dose will be the same for all groups: 10 sessions per week (7.5 hrs) of self-administered CCFES-assisted hand opening exercises performed at home plus 2 sessions per week (2.5 hrs) consisting of group-specific rTMS and CCFES-mediated functional task practice performed in the laboratory. Upper limb impairment, activity limitation, and patient-reported disability will be assessed at 0 (baseline), 6, 12 (end of treatment), 24, and 36 wks. Neurophysiology (IHI and excitability of uncrossed output) will be assessed at 0 (baseline), 12 (end of treatment), and 36 wks, on a separate day from functional motor outcomes assessment. MRI assessment of stroke lesion and location, and DTI assessment of corticospinal damage will be performed at baseline."
