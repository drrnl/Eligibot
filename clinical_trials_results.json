                    "briefSummary": "The study titled \" The Effect of Definitive Identification of Viral Etiology in Emergency Department Patients with Acute Respiratory Infection on Antibiotic Utilization (RADIATE)\" aims to investigate the effectiveness of a rapid diagnostic approach in reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in the emergency department (ED) for patients presenting with acute respiratory illness (ARI) due to a virus. Using a prospective design, eligible participants are individuals who visit the ED with complaints related to acute respiratory illness. The study will employ a single-arm consecutive enrollment approach. The intervention involves the implementation of a rapid point-of-care multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to promptly identify the viral cause of the infection. By utilizing a rapid diagnostic tool to identify viral etiology, the study aims to provide healthcare professionals in the ED with more accurate information to guide treatment decisions. Ultimately, the goal is to decrease the unnecessary use of antibiotics for ARI's due to a virus, which has several negative outcomes including promotion of antibiotic resistance, exacerbating ED length of stay and encouraging unnecessary additional diagnostic tests.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This prospective single-center, single-arm clinical trial will be conducted to study the initiation of a new diagnostic pathway for acute respiratory illness. After confirming eligibility following ED triage, patients will be enrolled to undergo the Spotfire syndromic assessment (Biomerieux, Inc.). Samples for the test will be collected via a nasopharyngeal swab administered by triage nurse or ED technician in triage. Results from test will be available in approximately 15 minutes. Patients with signs and symptoms of sore throat determined by throat pain or exudates on tonsils will also be tested for Group A streptococcus at enrollment.\n\nPrior to enrollment, the research team asked the initial clinician to delay ordering additional tests until the test was resulted.\n\nPatients who present to the ED with complaints of ARI will be considered eligible for the study. The intervention involves the use of a rapid point-of-care multiplex PCR test (Spotfire) to identify etiology of patients with ARI. Specimen samples will be collected by research staff at the time of ED presentation. Upon collection, the sample will be promptly prepared for testing on the SPOTFIRE R Panel device. The device will be in the ED to facilitate testing and accelerate delivery of diagnostic results to clinicians. The time when the provider receives the results will be recorded to evaluate the incorporation of results in clinical decision making.\n\nFor providers who do prescribe antibiotics, the investigators will ask for rationale for antibiotic prescription. Possible causes include: (1) concern for non-respiratory co-infection; (2) concern for respiratory co-infection. (3) patient request; (4) mitigation of legal risk. (5) significant co-morbidities. (6) personal preference / long-standing practice. (7) considered local standard of care. (8) other. In addition to questions above, investigators will specifically ask if physician was more likely to give antibiotics because the viral test was negative.\n\nPatients will also be queried about why they came to the ED including if they had a specific intention to receive antibiotics, additional testing or other reasons.\n\nBoth patients and providers will be asked about their confidence in diagnosis, importance of getting results same day.\n\nThe investigators will record the time of triage, time of nasopharyngeal swab, time of test results and time communicated with clinician and time that any additional tests are ordered. The results of the test include the presence of any pathogens.\n\nAfter discharge, patient will receive a chart review, including ICD-10 code, disposition, summary of test results, Strep test ordered and resulted, antibiotics given in ED (and time), ED length of stay, ED discharge, additional diagnostic tests (i.e., chest X-ray, other lab tests.)\n\nThe trial was designed to measure the antibiotic prescribing rate for subjects with a definitive viral etiology, a definitive bacterial etiology and no etiology identified. The study team planned an analysis to assess the antibiotic prescribing rate of those with a definitive viral infection versus those with no etiology identified or bacterial origin.\n\nFor all consented and tested patients, the investigators will record baseline patient demographics and characteristics. Group data will be compared for equality and inequality of variances, and for non-normality. Continuous variables between groups will be compared by their means using appropriate t-tests after testing for equality of variances. Discrete or categorical variables will be compared between groups by their proportions using chi-square tests. Non-normal data will be tested using non-parametric tests where appropriate. The testing of the difference between groups of some outcome variables will be done with adjustment for their baseline measures. Either an Analysis of Covariance for continuous data or a logistic regression for discrete data will be used as appropriate for these procedures. A minimum significance interval of 0.05 will be used for all comparison tests."

Nasal mucosa is the initial infection site of influenza infection. Single cell sequencing of nasal mucosal cell that may provide valuable insights into host response to influenza infection.\n2. Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Although bacteria are considered as the main pathgens of sepsis\uff0cSARS-CoV-2 or influenza infection also can cause multiple organ dysfunction which meet the definition of Sepsis 3.0. Viral sepsis has not received enough attention for a long time. It is important to understand the difference between viral sepsis and bacterial sepsis that may help to develop better strategies to diagnose and treat sepsis.\n3. Viral pneumonia is one of the leading infectious cause of death woldwide.Pneumina is the most common cause of sepsis.The mechanism of viral pneumonia progressing to sepsis needs to be further investigated."

OBOE will recruit and randomize participants over 3 years (3 annual cohorts of participants). Recruitment for each of the yearly cohorts of OBOE will begin in February. Each cohort will be followed for a 2-6-month run-in period with the objective to gain control of each participant's asthma and to stabilize the required controller medication step level. Participants will receive routine asthma care every 1-2 months (a total of 2-4 times) during run-in using a previously described algorithm developed by the Inner-city Asthma Consortium and successfully employed in the PROSE study. The primary outcome is the change in the amount of nasal IFN-\u03b1 recovered by nasal fluid absorption between two time points, within 72 hours of onset of a URI as defined by onset of (or substantial worsening of) rhinorrhea, nasal congestion or sneezing (single or multiple symptoms) and 3-6 days after study drug injection."

                    "briefSummary": "Chronic obstructive lung disease is a disabling disease that affects people usually after several years of smoke tobacco exposure and affects millions of patients worldwide. The disease is marked by multiples episode of worsening, termed exacerbations necessitating frequent hospitalizations. During these exacerbations, patients present breathless, and in the most severe cases, are admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for respiratory assistance. Currently, respiratory assistance is provided by a ventilator via a oronasal mask (referred to non-invasive ventilation, NIV), that helps patients to cope with their breathless. The mask is not always well tolerated and the ventilator sessions are delivered intermittently. In the past decade, a new technique that provides air-oxygen with high flow has been developed. This technique, called High Flow via Nasal Cannula (HFNC) can deliver from 21 to 100% heated and humidified air-oxygen at a high flow of gas via simple nasal cannula. Recent studies have shown that the technique is very efficient to treat patients presenting with acute respiratory failure who don't have any underlying chronic pulmonary disease. Whether the technique would be also efficient in patients with COLD presenting with severe exacerbations has not yet been demonstrated. Since HFNC does not require any mask, it is thought that the comfort of the patient would be much better in comparison to NIV and could potentially help to treat many patients with the disease. The objective of the present study is to study the physiological effect of HFNC as compared to NIV in patients with severe exacerbations of COPD and to show that it is non-inferior to NIV.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Design: Prospective, observational, cross-over, clinical physiologic study of HFNC and NIV in patients with COPD and hypercapnic respiratory failure Intervention: Participants will be consecutively ventilated with the two devices, i.e., HFNC and NIV. HFNC 30 and 50 L/min will be applied in a random order (sealed, opaque envelope). HFNC will be set with a temperature at 37\u00b0C or 34\u00b0C if perceived as too warm. NIV settings will be adjusted based on the clinical assessment of the Respiratory Therapist as per standard practice and will not be modified during the test. In both groups, FiO2 will be adjusted to achieve a SpO2 of at least 92%.\n\nSetting: The intervention will be applied in the Medical-Surgical ICU of St. Michael's Hospital.\n\nDuration: Each device will be studied for up to 30 minutes. The entire study will take place over up to 3 hours. There is no additional follow-up thereafter.\n\nProcedures: The study will start first by recording patients under spontaneous breathing considered as a baseline (sequence #1). Under spontaneous breathing, patients will be receiving oxygen therapy as it is usually done between 2 NIV sessions. Then, the patient will have up to 30 minutes to acclimatize to HFNC and select his/her preferred flow rate (sequence #2). NIV will be applied (sequence #3). The NIV settings will be adjusted based on the clinical assessment of the Respiratory Therapist and will not be modified throughout the study. Then, according to randomization order (sealed envelopes), patients will receive a flow corresponding to the preferred flow selected by the patient and a second flow, either HFNC 30 L/min or HFNC 50 L/min depending on the initial choice (sequences #4 and #5) (see flow diagram). FiO2 will be adjusted to achieve a SpO2 of 90 to 94%. Each condition will be studied fup to 30 minutes and will be separated by a 5-minute washout period during which patients will be receiving oxygen therapy. The measurements will be collected at baseline (under spontaneous breathing) and during the last five minutes of each condition. In case of clinical intolerance as considered by the attending physician, the study will stop. In case the patient is considered dependent of NIV by clinicians, we will still enroll the patient without doing baseline period after discussion with clinicians.\n\nThe pulse oximeter (SpO2) and transcutaneous CO2 monitor (SenTec Digital Monitoring System (SDMS)) will be continuously monitored throughout the study period. Exspiron or Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) device will be calibrated to measure minute ventilation. Four surface electrodes will be placed bilaterally to record each hemidiaphragm activity using a specific recording system (Acqknowledge software, Biopac Systems) A bedside ultrasound examination will be performed, using a SonoSite system (Fujifilm) equipped with a 10-15 MHz ultrasound linear probe. Diaphragm thickness will be measured both at end-inspiration and end-expiration. This technique will be applied at the end of each sequence (before ventilatory assist under conventional O2 therapy). In patients becoming rapidly intolerant to NIV disconnection, we will limit this \"baseline\" period under O2 to a minimum (5 minutes). The thickness and contraction of the intercostal muscles and abdominal muscles will also be assessed.\n\nInterpretation of the ultrasound results to determine diaphragm and other muscle thickness will be read at a later time by an individual blinded to the intervention."

Previous research has shown that increased dietary intake of total and plant-based protein is associated with a lower risk of sarcopenic obesity, using data from the EPIC Norfolk study. Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis showed that having sarcopenic obesity was associated with significantly impaired lung function outcomes. Other research has shown that increased intake of dietary protein leads to a better treatment outcome for respiratory diseases. The aim of this pilot observational study is to investigate, in more detail, the relationship between the quantity and source of dietary protein intake, the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity, and lung function, in a small cohort of older female participants with COPD. The study will also consider the role of inflammation in relation to sarcopenic obesity and lung function outcomes. This study will help to improve the understanding of the relationship between sarcopenic obesity and lung function outcomes, and how dietary protein intake and inflammation can affect this relationship and each of the outcomes."

Some individuals experience longer asymptomatic periods while others acute worsening periods and/or exacerbations triggered by symptom multiplication factors. Medications are adjusted to the patients' respiratory function, self-assessment of health and emerging certain physical changes. A more effective treatment may be applied by real-time data registered during the patient's everyday life Effective, safe, accessible, and engaging digital healthcare solutions which are able to be integrated into global healthcare systems may play a role in helping to meet this demand in COPD care needs. Digital interventions are unrestricted by individual practices or healthcare systems and come in a range of forms, including: synchronous applications (apps) which provide real-time video conferencing or telephone calls; asynchronous solutions such as emails, smartphone messages, or notifications; remote monitoring or recording devices, such as traditional telehealth interventions; information providing devices; and modern multi-tooled digital health apps which can facilitate behavioural changes and self-management..\n\nHYPOTHESES:\n\nDigital Health Integration with pulmonary rehabilitation has no effect on ventilatory, cognitive and physical functions in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.\n\nRESEARCH QUESTION:\n\nDoes Digital Health Integration with pulmonary rehabilitation influence ventilatory, cognitive and physical functions in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease?"

Assess the abuse liability and appeal of commercial e-cigarettes containing metatine versus nicotine.\n\nIII. Determine the impact of metatine on e-cigarette puffing behavior (topography).\n\nOUTLINE: Participants attend 3 sessions where they will be randomized to 1 of 3 types of e-cigarette. Participants will use the e-cigarette ad-libitum for 30 minutes and answer survey questions about their perceptions of the e-cigarette. Participants must also undergo 4 blood draws during the vaping session."
