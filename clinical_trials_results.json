                    "briefSummary": "Chronic obstructive lung disease is a disabling disease that affects people usually after several years of smoke tobacco exposure and affects millions of patients worldwide. The disease is marked by multiples episode of worsening, termed exacerbations necessitating frequent hospitalizations. During these exacerbations, patients present breathless, and in the most severe cases, are admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for respiratory assistance. Currently, respiratory assistance is provided by a ventilator via a oronasal mask (referred to non-invasive ventilation, NIV), that helps patients to cope with their breathless. The mask is not always well tolerated and the ventilator sessions are delivered intermittently. In the past decade, a new technique that provides air-oxygen with high flow has been developed. This technique, called High Flow via Nasal Cannula (HFNC) can deliver from 21 to 100% heated and humidified air-oxygen at a high flow of gas via simple nasal cannula. Recent studies have shown that the technique is very efficient to treat patients presenting with acute respiratory failure who don't have any underlying chronic pulmonary disease. Whether the technique would be also efficient in patients with COLD presenting with severe exacerbations has not yet been demonstrated. Since HFNC does not require any mask, it is thought that the comfort of the patient would be much better in comparison to NIV and could potentially help to treat many patients with the disease. The objective of the present study is to study the physiological effect of HFNC as compared to NIV in patients with severe exacerbations of COPD and to show that it is non-inferior to NIV.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Design: Prospective, observational, cross-over, clinical physiologic study of HFNC and NIV in patients with COPD and hypercapnic respiratory failure Intervention: Participants will be consecutively ventilated with the two devices, i.e., HFNC and NIV. HFNC 30 and 50 L/min will be applied in a random order (sealed, opaque envelope). HFNC will be set with a temperature at 37\u00b0C or 34\u00b0C if perceived as too warm. NIV settings will be adjusted based on the clinical assessment of the Respiratory Therapist as per standard practice and will not be modified during the test. In both groups, FiO2 will be adjusted to achieve a SpO2 of at least 92%.\n\nSetting: The intervention will be applied in the Medical-Surgical ICU of St. Michael's Hospital.\n\nDuration: Each device will be studied for up to 30 minutes. The entire study will take place over up to 3 hours. There is no additional follow-up thereafter.\n\nProcedures: The study will start first by recording patients under spontaneous breathing considered as a baseline (sequence #1). Under spontaneous breathing, patients will be receiving oxygen therapy as it is usually done between 2 NIV sessions. Then, the patient will have up to 30 minutes to acclimatize to HFNC and select his/her preferred flow rate (sequence #2). NIV will be applied (sequence #3). The NIV settings will be adjusted based on the clinical assessment of the Respiratory Therapist and will not be modified throughout the study. Then, according to randomization order (sealed envelopes), patients will receive a flow corresponding to the preferred flow selected by the patient and a second flow, either HFNC 30 L/min or HFNC 50 L/min depending on the initial choice (sequences #4 and #5) (see flow diagram). FiO2 will be adjusted to achieve a SpO2 of 90 to 94%. Each condition will be studied fup to 30 minutes and will be separated by a 5-minute washout period during which patients will be receiving oxygen therapy. The measurements will be collected at baseline (under spontaneous breathing) and during the last five minutes of each condition. In case of clinical intolerance as considered by the attending physician, the study will stop. In case the patient is considered dependent of NIV by clinicians, we will still enroll the patient without doing baseline period after discussion with clinicians.\n\nThe pulse oximeter (SpO2) and transcutaneous CO2 monitor (SenTec Digital Monitoring System (SDMS)) will be continuously monitored throughout the study period. Exspiron or Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) device will be calibrated to measure minute ventilation. Four surface electrodes will be placed bilaterally to record each hemidiaphragm activity using a specific recording system (Acqknowledge software, Biopac Systems) A bedside ultrasound examination will be performed, using a SonoSite system (Fujifilm) equipped with a 10-15 MHz ultrasound linear probe. Diaphragm thickness will be measured both at end-inspiration and end-expiration. This technique will be applied at the end of each sequence (before ventilatory assist under conventional O2 therapy). In patients becoming rapidly intolerant to NIV disconnection, we will limit this \"baseline\" period under O2 to a minimum (5 minutes). The thickness and contraction of the intercostal muscles and abdominal muscles will also be assessed.\n\nInterpretation of the ultrasound results to determine diaphragm and other muscle thickness will be read at a later time by an individual blinded to the intervention."

                    "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, single-arm, single center phase I/IIa observational study to systematically investigate outcomes and quality of life in patients with grade II or III bleeding predominant internal hemorrhoids referred to Vascular and Interventional Radiology (VIR) by Colorectal Surgery (CRS) for clinically indicated rectal artery embolization. 20 adult patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be consented and enrolled in the study.\n\nDuring the study, the subject will undergo 6 study visits, one before and five after their clinical rectal artery embolization procedure. Patients referred from the Colorectal Surgery Clinic who are scheduled to undergo rectal artery embolization (RAE) as part of standard clinical care will be enrolled. Baseline anoscopy and clinical evaluation will be performed per standard clinical care in the Colorectal Surgery Clinic and baseline patient reported outcomes and quality of life questionnaires administered. A research pelvis CTA will be performed on a clinical CT scanner per standard clinical imaging protocol for assessment of the rectal arteries prior to embolization. Following rectal artery embolization, subjects will undergo a day 1 post-procedure clinical evaluation in Interventional Radiology followed by repeat anoscopy and clinical evaluation per standard clinical care in the Colorectal Surgery Clinic as well as repeat patient reported outcomes and quality of life questionnaires at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post rectal artery embolization with a clinical research study coordinator in Vascular and Interventional Radiology, either in person or virtually (video or phone).\n\nThe aims of the study are:\n\nAim 1. To determine the 12-month efficacy of rectal artery embolization with particles + coils for treatment of symptomatic bleeding predominant hemorrhoidal disease\n\nAim 2. To determine the 12-month safety of rectal artery embolization with particles + coils for treatment of symptomatic bleeding predominant hemorrhoidal disease.\n\nAim 3. To determine the feasibility of pre-embolization CTA in identifying the hemorrhoidal arteries supplying the hemorrhoidal cushion"

Previous research has shown that increased dietary intake of total and plant-based protein is associated with a lower risk of sarcopenic obesity, using data from the EPIC Norfolk study. Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis showed that having sarcopenic obesity was associated with significantly impaired lung function outcomes. Other research has shown that increased intake of dietary protein leads to a better treatment outcome for respiratory diseases. The aim of this pilot observational study is to investigate, in more detail, the relationship between the quantity and source of dietary protein intake, the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity, and lung function, in a small cohort of older female participants with COPD. The study will also consider the role of inflammation in relation to sarcopenic obesity and lung function outcomes. This study will help to improve the understanding of the relationship between sarcopenic obesity and lung function outcomes, and how dietary protein intake and inflammation can affect this relationship and each of the outcomes."

                    "detailedDescription": "PURPOSE:\n\nto evaluate the efficacy of Digital Health Integration with pulmonary rehabilitation on ventilatory, cognitive and physical functions in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nchronic obstructive pulmonary diseases are conditions characterized by a variable progression. Some individuals experience longer asymptomatic periods while others acute worsening periods and/or exacerbations triggered by symptom multiplication factors. Medications are adjusted to the patients' respiratory function, self-assessment of health and emerging certain physical changes. A more effective treatment may be applied by real-time data registered during the patient's everyday life Effective, safe, accessible, and engaging digital healthcare solutions which are able to be integrated into global healthcare systems may play a role in helping to meet this demand in COPD care needs. Digital interventions are unrestricted by individual practices or healthcare systems and come in a range of forms, including: synchronous applications (apps) which provide real-time video conferencing or telephone calls; asynchronous solutions such as emails, smartphone messages, or notifications; remote monitoring or recording devices, such as traditional telehealth interventions; information providing devices; and modern multi-tooled digital health apps which can facilitate behavioural changes and self-management..\n\nHYPOTHESES:\n\nDigital Health Integration with pulmonary rehabilitation has no effect on ventilatory, cognitive and physical functions in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.\n\nRESEARCH QUESTION:\n\nDoes Digital Health Integration with pulmonary rehabilitation influence ventilatory, cognitive and physical functions in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease?"

Assess the abuse liability and appeal of commercial e-cigarettes containing metatine versus nicotine.\n\nIII. Determine the impact of metatine on e-cigarette puffing behavior (topography).\n\nOUTLINE: Participants attend 3 sessions where they will be randomized to 1 of 3 types of e-cigarette. Participants will use the e-cigarette ad-libitum for 30 minutes and answer survey questions about their perceptions of the e-cigarette. Participants must also undergo 4 blood draws during the vaping session."

Minimal invasive alternatives to haemorrhoidectomy have been introduced in the last decades to treat grade II/III haemorrhoids. Doppler-Guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation (DGHAL) represents a good therapeutic option in this condition with good short and mid-term outcomes but postoperative recurrence rates up to 35% at 5 years.\n\nRecently, a technique of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been introduced with promising outcomes. A recent systematic review reported a significant improvement of preoperative symptoms and a recurrence rate \\< 5%.\n\nTo date, there is no study comparing DGHAL to RFA in the treatment of grade II/III haemorrhoids.\n\nThe aim of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of failure rate of haemorrhoidal radiofrequency ablation compared to Doppler-guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation, associated with mucopexy, in the treatment of grade II and III haemorrhoidal disease"

                    "detailedDescription": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a frequent complication of chronic parenchymal lung diseases particularly in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and represents one of the major cause of all causes of PH. When present, PH contributes to more severe symptoms; exercise intolerance and can lead to right heart failure, which portends a worse prognosis and an increased mortality. Mechanisms of severe PH in chronic respiratory diseases are complex and include rarefaction of vascular bed, endothelial dysfunction and exaggerated pulmonary arterial remodeling. In patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), targeted medical therapies, including oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i), improve endothelial cell dysfunction, have vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects on the pulmonary vasculature, reduce the right ventricular afterload and improve symptoms, exercise capacity, and clinical outcomes in randomized trials. Several studies suggested a potential effect of PDE5i in COPD on dyspnea, exertional capacity and quality of life. However, these results were based on including small number of patients with heterogenous severity of lung disease and usually without complete hemodynamic evaluation. Data are lacking regarding the benefit/risk ratio of these treatments in the context of severe PH due to COPD. The main objective to this randomized controlled trial (16 weeks) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an oral PDE5i, tadalafil, in patients with severe PH due to COPD."
