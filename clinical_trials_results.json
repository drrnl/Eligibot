Clot dissolving (Fibrinolytic) drugs work to break down blood clots and have been found to improve health outcomes when applied directly into the hematoma within the brain. Patients who take part in this study will undergo the same surgical procedure that would normally be performed to treat them, but with the exception of TNK not rtPA."

Despite numerous attempts no trials showed a possibility to calculate and predict it's value although some patterns were found. Some modern navigational features allow to partially resolve this problem. Manual shift correction allows to displace brain structures but can only be used if brain shift is linear. Intraoperative computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow to update navigational data but violate surgical workflow and cannot display brain tissue in real time. Intraoperative sonography has poorer quality, limited observe volume and lengthy learning curve.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to calculate magnitude, type of intraoperative brain shift and assess possibility of it's prediction.\n\nFor each patient a surgeon intraoperatively will assess location of brain surface, various intracranial structures and lesion margins during surgery. Postoperatively these data will be compared to lesion's characteristics, patient's state and intraoperative features."

                    "detailedDescription": "Intraoperative sonography is usially used in neurooncology to detect brain tumors and exclude their remnants. A few studies describe it's usage while removing hematomas or vascular malformations. Ultrasound is the only method allowing to observe brain tissue in real time. It is chip and doesn't violate surgical workflow. Main disadvantages of sonography are lengthy learning curve and poorer image quality compared to magnetic resonance imaging. Novel acoustic coupling fluid, contrast-enhanced ultrasound and elastography expanded it's effectiveness. Meanwhile problems of locating of isoechogenic lesions with poor margins and elimination of artefacts are steel actual.\n\nObjective of the study is to determine possibilities of intraoperative sonography in detecting of various brain mass lesions, assessing extent of their resection and define indications to use ultrasound-guided needle or ultrasound wire-guided port.\n\nA surgeon will intraoperatively locate mass lesion and assess extent of it's resection with sonography. Ultrasound scanning will be performed through the same surgical approach or at a distance through enlarged craniotomy, periodically or permanently. To facilitate approach to subcortical and deep small mass lesions ultrasound-guided needle or ultrasound wire-guided port will be used."

All hospitals are located in Zhejiang Province. Patients' data were entered by local trained registrars using standardised protocols, and the overall process of case registration, monitoring of the data quality, and inquiry and correction of erroneous data was managed and supervised by a steering committee.\n\nWe included adult patients who (1) admitted for primary ICH ; (2) underwent blood routine test (hemoglobin included) and CT scan as soon as they arrived at hospital; (3) were not treated with neurosurgical procedures. We excluded patients who (1) had ICH secondary to known causes, including trauma, intracranial neoplasm and systemic diseases12, as well as anticoagulative agents; or had isolated intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH); (2) mRS \\>2 before the current ICH episode (according to past medical records or description from guardians.\n\nThis study was approved by human research ethic committees at all participating centers, and conducted in compliance with the principles set forward by the Declaration of Helsinki."

                    "briefSummary": "Over twelve million strokes occur worldwide every year, and stroke is the second most common cause of death globally. Strokes happen because blood supply to the brain is damaged. This can be due to a blockage (ischaemic stroke) or a bleed (haemorrhagic stroke - or intracranial haemorrhage). Intracranial haemorrhage can be life-threatening and patients with this type of stroke can be very sick, requiring urgent medical care including medications, close monitoring, and sometimes surgery.\n\nStrokes happen worldwide, but over 80% of stroke cases and associated death and disability occur in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), where resources to manage them can be limited. However, the differences in how patients present, the hospital care they receive, and their overall outcomes when compared to high-income countries (HICs) patients are not fully understood. There are many stroke-related deaths occurring each year around the world, especially among those who have presented with an intracranial haemorrhage, and if survival rates are to be improved, high-quality data is needed to help us better understand where the improvements in care are required in different health settings.\n\nRun and funded by the University of Cambridge, this study will collect data on all patients across all ages during a one-month period who undergo treatment for spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage, both medical and surgical. We will include patients from any hospital across the world that treats patients with this condition, collecting data from their admission to hospital until their discharge, death or up to 30 days from their presentation.\n\nThis is an observational study, so we are only observing patients care and management, not making any direct changes to their treatment. We will also be asking each centre to complete a written survey, to better understand some of the more complex areas which are important for the care of intracranial haemorrhage patients such as hospital resources available, and the potential barriers they face in accessing appropriate healthcare.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Objectives Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, with the greatest burden in LMICs. Haemorrhagic stroke or spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage (sICH), including intraparenchymal haemorrhage (IPH) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), has the greatest mortality and morbidity. Local management practices for haemorrhagic stroke vary greatly between geographical regions. This study aims to provide a comprehensive international overview of the patient characteristics, processes of care and short-term outcomes of patients being treated for sICH across high- and low-income settings.\n\nMethods Study design: Prospective, international observational cohort study.\n\nSetting: Any unit assessing patients with sICH is eligible to participate. Each participating unit will form a study team responsible for local approval processes, patient identification and data collection. Data will be collected online in anonymised form and will be analysed by the central study team according to a pre-determined statistical analysis plan.\n\nCase definition:\n\nPatients can be entered into the study if they meet the following criteria. \u2022 Patients of all ages with evidence of spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage (parenchymal, intraventricular and / or subarachnoid haemorrhage) on imaging (and absence of a history of trauma)\n\nAND:\n\n\u2022 Hospital admission for management of sICH All patients admitted to hospital meeting the above criteria during a given consecutive 30-day period during the study period will be included.\n\nResults Data relating to the initial presentation, patient factors, management, and short-term outcomes of patients with sICH will be collected. The dataset includes patient demographics, details of the ictus, medical management, complications, timing and nature of surgical intervention (where applicable), post-intervention care and supporting management, and immediate post-operative complications. Primary outcome is 30-day mortality. Variation in processes of care and resources will be described. Where guidelines are available, outcomes will be assessed against guideline standards.\n\nConclusions This study aims to provide a global snapshot of the patient factors, management, processes of care and short-term outcomes of patients with spontaneous ICH and describe the global neurosurgical burden of haemorrhagic stroke. It will serve as a platform to facilitate future research and collaboration in global cerebrovascular surgery and stroke care."

                    "briefSummary": "This is a domain within the ACT-GLOBAL platform trial to compare the effectiveness of early and appropriate pharmacological interventions in acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) to control secondary brain injury. Up to 2000 patients with presumed spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) will be followed for 6 months (or death, if prior to 6 months).\n\nAdaptive interim analyses will be used, with statistical triggers to determine if any of the interventions are superior to control. The end of the trial is defined as the date that all participants have completed their 6-month assessment.\n\nA large amount of preclinical data indicates that the outcome from ICH is linked to the detrimental effects of breakdown substances from brain bleeds. However, there remains a lack of compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness of any pharmacological intervention that can mitigate the secondary cerebral injury. The INTERACT domain aims to assess the effectiveness of intravenous deferoxamine and low-dose oral colchicine, both individually and in combination, to standard of care alone, on improving functional outcome in patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH.\n\nThose patients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive one of four interventions:\n\n1. No deferoxamine mesylate and no colchicine (labeled as control)\n2. Deferoxamine mesylate only: deferoxamine mesylate at a dose of 32mg/kg/day via intravenous infusion immediately (within 1 hour) post-randomization and continue for the following 2 consecutive days.\n3. Colchicine only: 0.5mg of oral colchicine daily for 30 consecutive days.\n4. Both deferoxamine mesylate and colchicine: deferoxamine mesylate at a dose of 32mg/kg/day via intravenous infusion immediately (within 1 hour) post-randomization and continue for the following 2 consecutive days; plus 0.5mg of oral colchicine daily for 30 consecutive days.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe type of stroke, responsible for substantial disability and death worldwide. It accounts for 6.5% to 19.6% of all strokes, with incidence rates increasing, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Survivors often face significant consequences, including functional impairments, recurrent strokes, cognitive decline, and depression.\n\nDespite advancements in acute stroke care, there are few effective treatments specifically targeting the brain damage caused by ICH. Previous research has identified that the formation of perihaematomal oedema (PHE) is a critical factor in poor recovery, making it a key focus for therapeutic development.\n\nINTERACT5 domain will focus on two promising medications. Deferoxamine, an iron-chelating agent, targets oxidative stress caused by iron released from damaged brain tissue. Studies suggest it may reduce brain swelling and secondary injury after ICH. Colchicine, an anti-inflammatory medication, inhibits pathways involved in inflammation, which may help minimize brain damage. INTERACT5 will enroll patients aged 18-80 with acute spontaneous supratentorial ICH, confirmed through imaging, who present to the hospital within 24 hours of symptom onset. Other domain-specific inclusion criteria:\n\n* Hematoma volume \u2265\u226510 mL or any volume post-surgery\n* NIHSS score \\>8\n* GCS \u22658\\>7\n\nParticipants will be randomized to one of four groups: standard care, deferoxamine alone, colchicine alone, or both treatments combined. Deferoxamine will be administered intravenously (32 mg/kg/day within 1 hour and continued for 2 consecutive days), and colchicine will be given orally (0.5 mg daily for 30 days).\n\nThe study's primary outcome is the improvements in functional outcomes at 6 months, measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Secondary outcomes include EQ-5D-5L at 6 months, changes in PHE size, NIHSS scores, length of hospital stay, ambulatory status at discharge and safety indicators such as mortality at 6 months/SAEs to 6 month, kidney and liver function.\n\nResponse Adaptive Randomization (RAR) will be used in this domain to allow readjustment of recruitment towards treatment arms with more favorable emerging effects. Randomization will use minimization method to minimize the imbalance between the number of patients in each treatment group over a number of factors including region, location (deep vs cortical)age (\\>65 vs \u226465 years old), sex (male vs female), time from onset (\\>6 vs \u22646 hours), haematoma volume (10-29 vs \u226530 mL), receipt of any decompressive surgery (yes vs no), and intraventricular extension of ICH, etc."

                    "briefSummary": "The investigators will perform follow-up on 500 cases of deep and lobar intracerebral hemorrhage to perform advanced neuroimaging before 45 days post stroke, and evaluations of motor and cognitive function at baseline, 3 months and 6 months to determine predictors of recovery, progressive cognitive or functional impairment.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the United States. More adults are affected by stroke each year than Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. Hemorrhagic strokes represent the most severe subtypes of stroke. An estimated 40-50% of hemorrhagic stroke victims will die and more than 80% of survivors remain disabled after hemorrhagic stroke. Yet the vast majority of analyses on outcome after stroke have focused principally on gross measures of functional outcome.\n\nFurthermore hemorrhagic stroke differs from ischemic stroke where a loss of blood causes the area affected to be readily visible on scanning. But with hemorrhagic stroke, not only the area that we can directly see, but nearby tracts that have been compressed or stretched by the mass of the hemorrhage can be injured.\n\nThe investigators propose to follow-up on 500 cases of deep and lobar ICH to perform serial evaluations of motor and cognitive function and advanced neuroimaging to determine predictors of recovery, progressive cognitive or functional impairment. Our proposal has the advantages of adding onto a prospective ICH study which will identify and recruit cases, ability to evaluate for the degree and impact of survival and severity biases, baseline neuroimaging which includes baseline MRI, biologic samples including genotyping for apolipoprotein E alleles and uniform phenotype definitions as well as expertise in recovery/outcome analyses, advanced neuroimaging processes and epidemiologic study. This proposal performs detailed cognitive, motor and functional assessments on cases of intracerebral hemorrhage and correlates with tractography imaging. The investigators hypothesize that unlike ischemic stroke, the mass effect of the hemorrhage itself may disrupt nearby tracts in some patients while preserving them in others and will serve as a better predictor of who may recover after ICH. This project will represent the largest number of ICH cases in which tractography imaging has been performed to date.\n\nSpecific Aim #1: Improve motor recovery prediction after supratentorial ICH by adding proportion of tract injury as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) independent of the ICH volume, location, age, gender and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).\n\nHypothesis #1a: Increasing severity of injury to corticospinal tracts in ICH patients will predict worse specific motor deficits assessed at 3-month and 6-month post-stroke.\n\nHypothesis #1b. Injury to cortical-cortical tracts including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, and arcuate fasciculus, will predict greater impairment in corresponding cognitive domains including attention, memory, executive function, and language function assessed at 3 and 6-month post-stroke.\n\nSpecific Aim #2: Determine the association of periventricular tract injury in intraventricular hemorrhage complicating ICH with subsequent incontinence and gait ataxia.\n\nHypothesis #2: Patients with IVH will be associated with greater periventricular tract injury than patients without IVH and that this injury will be independently associated with long-term neurogenic incontinence and gait instability after controlling for severity of the ICH including location and volume, age and gender."

                    "briefSummary": "The aim of this observational study is to determine how and why inadequate brain blood flow occurs after bleeding in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Treatment for strokes caused by burst blood vessels involves reducing blood pressure (BP) to stop the bleeding. However, this reduction in BP may affect blood flow, causing blockages in blood vessels within the brain. Fast breathing also affects brain blood flow. Therefore, participants will be asked to undergo a simple brain blood flow assessment using transcranial Doppler (TCD) within 48 hours upon admission to hospital. Patients will then have a follow-up TCD assessment at 4-7 days post-ICH onset, in addition to an MRI scan at \\>7 days. This research will help to confirm if blockages after bleeding are caused by reduced blood flow within the brain.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Stroke is the second-leading cause of death worldwide, with high mortality and morbidity rates. One stroke type, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), refers to spontaneous, non-traumatic bleeding, within the brain tissue and is the second most common cause of stroke. Although ICH can happen at any age, it is more common over the age of 70. The most common cause of ICH is hypertension, which can cause bursting of cerebral blood vessels, resulting in bleeding within the brain. National and international guidelines strongly advocate systolic blood pressure (BP) lowering in ICH as part of \"bundled\" care, reducing fluctuations in cerebral blood velocity (CBv). However, despite blood pressure (BP) lowering being deemed clinically safe, no reduction in death or disability at 90 days was demonstrated in two landmark large randomised controlled trials. Moreover, reductions in BP may affect CBv to the whole of the brain, inadvertently causing ischaemic stroke (blockage of the blood supply).\n\nPrevious literature has identified that mild-to-moderate ICH stroke severity benefits from early and stable BP lowering, but those with excessively systolic high BP (\\>220 mmHg) prior to lowering suffer significantly higher rates of neurological deterioration. In order to understand the relationship between BP changes and potential clinical benefit in ICH, it needs to be determined if there is a global reduction in brain perfusion which is causing ischaemic lesions in the brain following ICH.\n\nProspective studies have shown impairments in dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA), cerebrovascular tone, and cerebrovascular resistance in acute ICH. Moreover, meta-analyses have demonstrated a previously unreported confounder to cerebral autoregulatory function: the presence of an acute reduction in spontaneous CO2 tension after ICH, potentially reflecting spontaneous hyperventilation (measured as partial pressure in arterial blood (pCO2) in patients in intensive care and on the ward). There is no current explanation for the presence of spontaneous hyperventilation post-ICH. However, it has been shown that across a range of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) values, cerebral blood flow (CBF), dCA, and other core haemodynamic parameters (arterial BP and heart rate) have a dose-response relationship.\n\nFast breathing is also known to affect CBv. When EtCO2 is low, rapid acute cerebral vasoconstriction can occur - risking acute ischaemic injury. Therefore, in the presence of spontaneous hyperventilation or induced hyperventilation, reductions in brain perfusion through vasoconstriction could risk new or worsened ischaemic insults, particularly in the presence of BP lowering. Whilst the presence of cerebral small vessel disease plays a role in incidence of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions after ICH, there have been no mechanistic association studies to date linking key confounding factors: BP lowering, EtCO2 change, dCA, and ischaemic lesions.\n\nThe investigators aim to perform transcranial Doppler (TCD) to measure CBv in patients with ICH within 48 hours of admission to hospital. These patients would then have a follow-up TCD assessment at 4-7 days post-ICH onset, in addition to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (\\>7 days). Data would be collected and analysed to determine the relationship between cerebral haemodynamics and ischaemic lesions on MRI, post-acute ICH."

Besides stroke unit care, no specific treatment has been proven effective yet. Perihaematomal oedema (PHO) could be a promising therapeutic target. However, the mechanisms, the natural history as well as the clinical impact of this PHO remain unclear. The COPITCH study has been designed to answer these questions"

                    "briefSummary": "This multicenter, pragmatic randomized, open-label clinical trial aims to assess whether Tranexamic Acid improves outcomes in adult patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage.\n\nThe participants presenting within 4.5 hours of the onset of symptoms of stroke with intracerebral haemorrhage confirmed on Computed Tomography (CT Scan) will be randomized into two groups in a 1:1 ratio using a central online randomization. The treatment arm will consist of giving intravenously 2 grams of Tranexamic Acid in 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride administered over 45 minutes. Control arm patients will receive standard of care treatment as per the institutional protocol. In both arms, intensive systolic blood pressure reduction to less than 140 mmHg will be done using antihypertensive medications, which has to be achieved within one hour and will be maintained over next seven days. The choice of antihypertensive drug will depend on the clinician's preference.\n\nBoth groups will have a repeat CT scan after 24 hours to check for any increase in the haematoma volume. Any deterioration in the neurological status will warrant urgent brain imaging. On day 7, the patient will be assessed for their NIHSS score and mRS score. On day 90, quality of life and the functional outcome will be assessed.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Global Burden of Disease, Injury and Risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke 2010 estimated the burden of spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) in India is profound (32 -49%) and it is associated with high mortality (up to 63 %) due to haematoma expansion which occurs in 38% of ICH within first few hours of presentation. Early administration of haemostatic drugs has been used in patients with trauma and was associated with improved outcomes. Similarly, if haemostatic drugs are administered early, which can be a simple and cost-effective intervention, may improve the functional outcomes in patients with sICH. Recently, the Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary IntraCerebral Haemorrhage (TICH 2 trial), which was done to see the effectiveness of the administration of tranexamic acid on hematoma expansion and functional outcomes at three months in patients who presented with sICH within 8 hours of presentation of symptoms onset, showed a decrease in haematoma expansion but no improvement in functional outcome at 90 days. Further larger randomized control trials are required to ascertain the effect of early administration of Tranexamic acid (TXA) in sICH. In India patients present to hospitals in the early stages that have developed symptoms after sICH and we propose to study the effect of intravenous Tranexamic Acid for hyperacute primary intracerebral haemorrhage within 4.5 hours of sICH.\n\nTrial Population:\n\nThis multi-centric study will be conducted at 50 stroke centres in India associated with the INSTRuCT Network. All patients presenting with symptoms of stroke to the hospital and admitted to the stroke units will be screened for eligibility and if met, will be included in the study. The INTRINSIC trial intends to recruit 3400 patients.\n\nTrial Design:\n\nINTRINSIC Trial will be a multicenter, randomized, open-label, clinical trial. The participants will be randomized into two groups in a 1:1 ratio using a central database of INSTRuCT central online randomization. The baseline characteristics will be adjusted to stroke severity using the NIHSS score and the volume of haematoma. The treatment arm will consist of giving intravenously 2 grams of Tranexamic Acid in 100 ml sodium chloride 0.9 % administered over 45 minutes. Control arm patients will receive standard of care management as per the institutional protocol. Both groups will have a repeat CT scan after 24 hours to check for any increase in the haematoma volume. Any deterioration in the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) will warrant urgent brain CT scans. Antihypertensive drugs used and their doses to control BP will be recorded for up to 7 days. On day 7, the patient will be assessed for their NIHSS score and mRS score. On day 90, quality of life and the functional outcome will be assessed.\n\nThe need for this study:\n\nThe proportion of ICH is high in India and other LMIC's, particularly in Asia. Currently, there are no effective treatments available for sICH. Moreover, Tranexamic Acid is cheap, easily available and easy to administer."
